# MoviePass-App (Still too early to cancel your membership!) 


Shiny app to search and filter movies for **MoviePass** users in the selected locations. **MoviePass** has announced that it is limiting the movies that subscribers can see for the foreseeable [schedule](https://www.moviepass.com/movies/), which means that users can not go watch a movie right away after they find a high-rated one by IMDb. This app is able to provide the following features:

* a sortable list of MoviePass-supported movies by the ratings and number of votes from IMDb.com updated on a daily basis. 
* a interactive interface of movies at each day with the movie information and its poster. 
* a search engine allowing users to customize when and where they would like to watch it.
